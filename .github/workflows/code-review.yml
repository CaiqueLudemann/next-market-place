            Review this PR following CLAUDE.md guidelines. Focus on:
            - Critical bugs and security issues
            - TypeScript type safety violations
            - Missing or inadequate tests (TDD compliance)
            - Code quality issues (not style - linters handle that)

            Be concise. Only report issues that matter. Skip minor suggestions.
